Between instrument (or between human).Within instrumenterrors mean thatthe sameinstrument can give different measurements on different occasions. Between instrument errors mean thattwo seemingly identical instruments can give different measurements.Similarly, within human errors mean that an individualusing the same instrument can obtain different measurements on different occasions, whilebetween human errors mean that two people using the same instrument can obtain different measurements on the same occasion.Error cannot be entirely eliminated but steps shouldbe taken to minimise it (Bowling 1997). Good instrumentsshould be designedtominimise instrument error.In social research,this means ensuring thatquestionnaires and observational checklists are clear and easy to understand, and thatthe questionsasked only addressthe phenomena that are being studied.For example, if you are interested in measuring difficulty with feeding in older people with dementia,then you shouldask questions which address that problem alone and omitany questions that address otheraspects of behavior such as agitation or wandering.In designing instruments,abalance shouldbe struck between ‘authenticity’ and ‘directness’ (Messick 1994). An authentic instrument measuresas much as possible about a phenomenon, at the risk of becoming indirect, while adirect instrument focuseson only the itemsdirectlyconcerned with the phenomenon,at the risk of losing some authenticity.[B head] Reliability and validityReliability and validityinvolveestimating-and minimising -the level of errorassociated with measurements made using a given instrument(Streiner and Norman 2008). Reliabilityis the extent to which an instrument makes the same measurementeach time it is used.Validityis the extent to which the measurement made by an instrument measures what we are interested in.
6It is useful to consider physical measurement to explorethese concepts. For example, if we measure a patient’s blood pressure several times with a blood pressure monitoring device,we should get approximately the same measurement each time we use it, provided that the patient’s blood pressure has not changed.Allowing forhuman error, the measurements would be reliable.Now imagine that the blood pressure monitoring device isfaulty, so that it measuresblood pressure a few millimeters of mercury below the true value.Ifwe take successive measurementsof the patient’s blood pressure,we shall stillget the same measurementeach time we use the device. However, the measurementswill be wrong, because they are not valid.Thisillustrates an important point, which is that measurements can be reliable but not valid.  However,for measurementsto be considered valid, they shouldbe reliable.Reliability and validity can be tested and improved by making adjustments to instruments,if the levels of reliability and validity are too low. With questionnaires this usually involves revising the items in the questionnaire, removing orclarifying ambiguous questions. The principalfeatures of the different types of reliability andvalidity are provided in Table 2.[start table][Table head] Table 2Definitions and types of reliability and validityReliabilityDefinitionInternal consistencyThe extent to which all the items in a questionnaire measure the same thing.Test:re-testreliabilityThe extent to which an instrument (such as a test) gives the same result on two occasions.Intra-rater reliabilityThe extent to which the same person obtains the same measurement on two occasions.Inter-rater reliabilityThe extent to which two people obtain the same measurement.ValidityDefinition

For the purposes of this articlewe shall focus on the randomised controlled trial experimental design, used to test theeffect of treatments on people.[Chead] The randomised controlled trialThe randomised controlled trial is considered to be the best methodfortestingthe link between cause and effect in clinical interventions. Its essential features are randomisation and use of a controlgroup. The randomised controlled trial is rated near the top of the hierarchy of evidence, at level II, as a method of providing evidence for clinical practice (Centre for Reviews and 
8Dissemination 2009).It issuperseded in the hierarchy, only by systematic review with meta-analysis,a method of combining the results of randomised controlled trials and evaluating the combined evidence. Randomised controlled trials should preferably be ‘blind’: either those taking part do not know if they are in theintervention group or the control group,or the person who is collecting the data does not knowthis.The optimum designis the double-blind randomised controlled trial where neither the participants, nor the person collecting thedata,know who is in which group (Smith 2008).The simplest form of randomised controlled trialrequires at least two groups of participants: a treatment(also referred to as experimentalor intervention) group and a control group.The treatmentgroup receives the treatment being tested and the control group does not.However, the control group should be treated in exactly the same wayas the treatment group, or as closely to this as is possible, except that they do not receive the treatment.When testing drugs, for example, this is achieved by administering a ‘placebo’,which looks identical to the treatment drug, except that it contains no active ingredient.This matching of treatment in the two groups, as far as is possible,is to take into account the ‘placeboeffect’, whereby anyone involved in a randomised controlled trial -whether receiving the treatment or not -mayrespond as if they were beingtreated.The placebo effect must be the same in both groups for the effect of the active drug to be measured correctly.With nursing interventions, for example testing a support surface for pressure ulcer prevention, it may bedifficult to provide a placebo in quite the same way.In such cases it is customary to administer the usual care that a person may receive for pressure ulcerpreventionto the control group,and to compare this usual standard of care with the new support surfacebeing tested.
9There are many possible methods of allocating individuals who have agreed to participate in the randomisedcontrolled trial to either the treatment group or the control group. Randomisation is used to minimise bias inallocating individuals to the two groups.For example, we could be accused, sub-consciously or even deliberately, of allocating all the people who are more likely to respond to treatment to the treatmentgroup and the remainder to the control group.This might introducebias into the experiment,which couldexaggerate the effects of our treatment.Blinding, as explained above,is a process of concealment and can be either single blindor double blind. The purpose of blinding is to minimise bias in either the researcher or the participant, or both, by concealing to them that they are receiving the treatmentor the control(in the case of the participant) and/ or which participants are receiving the treatmentor the control(in the case of the researcher).Double blinding is preferred, butthis is difficult to achieve with nursing interventions.[B head] SurveysSurveys are oftenused in nursing research.  These frequentlyinvolve distributingquestionnaires;but they may also be conducted by interview or by observation.In contrast to experiments, surveys cannot easily distinguish between cause and effect, butthey are useful forgathering large amounts of data to describe samples and populations(Hallberg 2008).Surveys may be either cross-sectionalor longitudinal. Cross-sectional studies are relatively easy to conduct, as they only have to be done once.Longitudinal studies aremore complex, especially ones conducted over several years, as they require repeated surveys.Attritionisa significantproblem with longitudinal studies (Aldridge and Levine 2001).There are three different types of longitudinal survey design:trend studies, cohort studies and panel studies(Watson 2008). They each have their advantages and disadvantages. Trend studies areconcerned with trends in a population. Aclassic example is the study of voting 
10intentions in the run-up to general elections.Thepopulation is sampledon one day and again, at intervals. Thesamplesurveyedis always part of the same population but does not, necessarily, comprisethe same people.Therefore, this isa relatively simple type of survey to perform,but does not provideinformationabout how specific individualschange over time.Cohort studies and panel studies are similar in that they use the same sample groupat each stage—as opposed to different people at each stage—but they differ slightly in how they use the groups. In a cohort study, the studyuses a defined cohort (a group of people with a shared characteristic). The people surveyed at each stage, for example, could all belong to the nursing class of 2013,but the same individuals may not be surveyed each time;each groupsurveyed will be a sub-sampleof the definedcohort, ie the nursing class of 2013.In contrast, in a panel study,exactly the same people are surveyed at each stage.Therefore, cohort and panel studies are more informative about how individualschange over time than trend studies,but are more difficultto conduct andare susceptibleto attrition.[A head] Handling data from quantitative studiesQuantitative studies produce numbers which shouldbe interpreted before conclusions maybe drawn.These numbers (the data) may be entered, storedand analysedusing some form of electronic database.Data entry maybe into a Word©document or an Excel©Spreadsheet, for example.Some initialdata analysis is possible in Excel©, but data maybe imported into a statistical package, such asSPSS©(Statistical Package for the Social Sciences), to permitmore sophisticated analysis(Pallant 2007).Data entry oftenrequires transcriptionfrom hard copies of questionnaires or observational schedules. This has to be done carefully and double-checked.Increasingly,surveys are distributedvia the internet and data can be imported directly into an analytical package such as SPSS©.It is essential to store data carefully, once it has been entered into any package, as loss ofdatamayjeopardise thestudy.It is good practice to create 
11a master copy of the data, which should not be altered but maybe copied in the event that subsequent files are lost or inadvertently altered. It is essential to create and store safely abackup copyof the master copy in case it is inadvertently deleted or irretrievably altered.Security is important if data are sensitive or confidential.Files should not contain any information that could identify individual participants. Data should be stored safely and password protected.[B head] Statistical analysisQuantitative data maybe analysed statistically(Watson et al2006).Data maybe described in terms of percentages, central tendency (mode, median, mean) and spread (range andstandard deviation).  Theseterms are explained in Table 3.Analysis of the data in the sample may be used to draw inferencesabout the population as a whole. Analysis is usually performed using a set ofanalysesknown as inferential statistics.  These allow you to investigate, for example, the differences between the mean values in the treatment and controlgroups in arandomised controlled trialand to investigate the associations between variables such aspainand analgesic dose.The important criteria in inferential statisticsis whether something is statistically significant. Statistical significanceis usually expressed as a probability, which measures ‘How likely was this to happen anyway?’ If theprobability is very low, conventionally below 0.05 (less than a 1 in 20 chance), then we are justified in statingthat our observationis statistically significantat this probability. Statistically significance implies that the observed benefits arelikely to have happened as a resultof thetreatmentbeingtested,or that the observed relationship between variables is real.[Start table][Table head] Table 3 Definition of statistical termsTermDefinition

Instrumentsshould be designed to ensure that they have good reliability and validity.Random error cannot be eliminated in quantitative research. Instrument and human error can be eliminated or reduced. Experiments and surveysare used to study the relationship between variables.Experimental designs are best forrelating cause and effect. The most effective experimental design is the double-blind randomised controlled trial.Surveys are 
13most useful for studying peopleand populations. The vast majority of surveys are cross-sectional, but the best survey designs are longitudinal as these can be used to study changes in people and populations.In quantitative research, it is important to correctly collect data and store it securely on electronic databasesand to analyse quantitative data, using appropriate statistical methods.
