This procedure is performed until there are enough subjects in the sample. (b)Exponential non-Discriminative snowball sampling: This type begins with the adoption of the first subject, after which many recommendations are made. Additional referral information will be provided with each subsequent referral once there are enough subjects in the sample. (c)Exponential Discriminative Snowball Sampling:In this method, each subject provides multiple referrals, but only one subject is recruited from each subject. The type of research study influences the choice of new topics. 4.4.1.3 Purposive sampling The majority of qualitative studies eventually adopt a purposive or purposeful sampling strategy, which entails selecting specific cases from which the study can derive the greatest benefit.  4.4.1.4 Theoretical sampling This is a method of collecting data for the purpose of developing a theory. In this method, the analyst collects, codes, and analyzes all of his data together. The analyst then decides what data to collect next and where to find them in order to advance his theory as it emerges. In contrast, the three primary traditions also emphasize the qualitative sampling method. e.g., grounded theory, ethnography, and phenomenology. A phenomenological researcher will typically use a sample size of ten or fewer people, whereas a grounded theory researcher will typically use a theoretical sampling of twenty to thirty people. 4.4.2 Sampling Procedures in Quantitative Research Design Probability sampling is typically used in quantitative research designs (McCombes, 2022). Every member has a chance of being included in the sample through probability sampling. Consequently, it is the most reliable method of  sampling  if  a  researcher  wants  to  draw  valid  conclusions  from  their  findings  and  ensure  that  they  are representative of the entire population. Probabilistic sampling is commonly used in quantitative research designs (McCombes, 2022). Each member may be included in the sample through probability sampling. Therefore, if researchers want to draw valid conclusions from the results and ensure that they are representative of the population as a whole, this is the most reliable sampling method. The four primary sampling techniques are discussed below: 4.4.2.1 Simple Random sampling With simple random sampling, each person in the population has approximately the same chance of being selected. The entire population should be included in the sampling frame. Completely random techniques or tools such as random number generators can be used to do this type of sampling.

Every person in the population is given a number. However, rather than randomly assigning numbers, specific individuals are selected on a regular basis. However, when researchers use this method, it is important to ensure that the list does not contain hidden patterns that could skew the sample. 4.4.2.3 Stratified sampling In stratified sampling, the population is divided into subpopulations that are significantly different from each other. This method allows researchers to draw more accurate conclusions by ensuring that each subgroup is well represented in the sample. Researchers need to divide the population into subgroups (called strata) based on related characteristics. Gender, age group, income class, function. Samples are then randomly or systematically selected from each subgroup. 4.4.2.4 Cluster sampling Cluster sampling also involves dividing a population into subgroups. However, each subgroup should have characteristics comparable to those of the sample as a whole. Instead of randomly selecting individuals from each subgroup, we randomly select entire subgroups. Practically, all individuals from all sampling clusters could be included. If the clusters themselves are large, you can also select individuals from each cluster using one of the above methods. Multistage sampling is the name. This approach is useful when dealing with large and dispersed populations, but it is more likely to introduce sampling errors as there can be large differences between clusters. The primary purpose of sampling is to obtain a representative sample or small collection of units or cases from a larger collection or population so that researchers can study smaller groups and generalize accurately to larger groups. That's it. However, it is difficult to guarantee that the sampled clusters are representative of the entire population. Therefore, researchers need to understand and focus on specific methods to generate highly representative samples (Taherdoost, 2016). 4.4.3 Sampling Procedures in Mixed Research Design The term "mixed-methods" refers back to the procedure of mixing quantitative and qualitative studies designs (Onwuegbuzie  &  Collins,  2007).Understanding  the  sampling  techniques  utilized  in  each  quantitative  and qualitative studies is essential for mixed-methods approach sampling (Graff, n.d.).As changed into noted earlier, blended techniques provide some of advantages, inclusive of the designs complementing one another, stepped forward theoretical insight, incrementality or continuity, elevated validity, and the cappotential to rectify variations or inconsistencies in results (Govindan, 2014).The study's studies designs affect sampling in blended techniques studies (Teddlie & Yu, 2007).  Govindan pointed out, mentioning Green and Caracelli (1997), that aspect designs and incorporated designs are the 2 foremost styles of sampling techniques. e.g., sampling techniques which can be each probabilistic and non-probabilistic. Quantitative research usually appoint opportunity sampling techniques, which contain randomly choosing a big wide variety of gadgets from a populace or precise subgroups (strata) of a populace in order that the opportunity of inclusion for every member of the populace may be determined (Dawadi, Shrestha, & Giri, 2021).Additionally, fundamental blended approach sampling techniques, sequential blended approach sampling,

Purposive and probability sampling are both present in mixed method sampling. The table below lists the most important methods of sampling that are used in mixed research designs. Sampling Techniques Description References Probabilistic SamplingSimple random sampling Involves selecting elements at random from a sampling frame that lists all of the elements. The probability of selecting a subject in the sampling frame is independent of each other for each subject ( Collins, Onwuegbuzie, & Jiao, 2006); Govindan, 2014;  Teddlie  &  Yu, 2007 Stratified random sampling Sampling  frame  divides  the  population  into  relatively  homogenous subgroups from which elements are selected at random.  ( Collins, Onwuegbuzie, & Jiao, 2006); Govindan, 2014  Cluster sampling Multistage sampling is another name. Cluster sampling is the process of selecting successive random samples from larger to smaller units using either stratified or simple random methods ( Collins, Onwuegbuzie, & Jiao, 2006), Govindan, 2014 Systematic sampling Selecting individuals or cases from a list by selecting each member of the Kth sampling frame, where K is the typical population divided by the desired sample size. The researcher determines the sampling interval, which is the standard distance between the selected elements, by dividing the population size by the desired sample size. ( Collins, Onwuegbuzie, & Jiao, 2006); Teddlie & Yu,  2007;  Govindan, 2014 Multistage Random Selecting a sample from a random sampling scheme in numerous phases    ( Collins, Onwuegbuzie, & Jiao, 2006), Govindan, 2014 Non-Probabilistic Sampling Convenience sampling Utilizing the individuals who are most easily accessible as study participants is known as convenience sampling.  A random sampling is another name for it Dawadi,  Shrestha,  & Giri,  2021;  Govindan, 2014, Onwuegbuzie and Collins, 2007 Snowball sampling It is also known as chain sampling or network sampling. This method asks early sample members to find and refer additional people who meet the eligibility requirements Govindan, 2014; Onwuegbuzie     and Collins, 2007 Quota sampling A quota sample is one in which the researcher determines the necessary number  of  participants  from  each  population  stratum  and  identifies population strata Govindan, 2014; Teddlie & Yu, 2007 Purposive sampling Additionally known as judgmental sampling, itIt is based on the idea that the researcher's understanding of the population can be used to select individuals for the sample. "Particular settings, people, or events are deliberately selected for the important information they can provide that cannot be gotten as well Dawadi,  Shrestha,  & Giri,  2021;  Govindan, 2014;  Teddlie  &  Yu, 2007;

Relationship between QUAL and QUAN samples Identical sampling The same members participate in quantitative and qualitative phases of the study Govindan, 2014; Teddlie & Yu, 2007 Parallel sampling Member who participates get drawn from the same population while the samples obtained are for quantitative and qualitative study phases Dawadi,  Shrestha,  & Giri,  2021;  Govindan, 2014;  Teddlie  &  Yu, 2007 Nested sampling A subgroup of the whole sample participates in an supplementary study     Govindan, 2014; Teddlie & Yu, 2007 Multilevel sampling Two or more samples taken from the population of interest at various levels.  Govindan, 2014; Teddlie & Yu, 2007 5.1 An Analysis of Qualitative Data Collection Methods The main qualitative data collection methods are highlighted in the table below: Methods Brief Explanation References  Observation     The researcher observes (with or without participation) study subjects in order to understand whether or not they act as they say they will and gain tacit knowledge of the subjects. Joffe  and  Yardley (2003); Kabir (2016) Interview  This entails in-depth questioning, listening to and recording of individual or group responses in a structured, semi-structured, or unstructured format. Govindan,    2014; Kabir (2016) Focus   group discussions Focused, interactive session that is guided by a set of questions and has a group that is small enough for everyone to have a chance to talk and large enough to have a variety of opinions. Kabir (2016) 5.2 Quantitative Data Collection Methods According to Kabir (2016), data collection is the deliberate and systematic process of obtaining and analyzing information about relevant variables in order to answer a specific research question, test hypotheses, and evaluate results. Methods vary by industry, but ensuring true and accurate collection remains important. All types of data collection aim to analyze large amounts of data and collect high-quality evidence that can be used to create strong reasons to answer questions. Data  for  quantitative  research  designs  come  from  two  distinct  sources:  secondary  and  primary  data.  The researchers first collect primary data, and secondary data is gathered from other sources. As per Kabir (2016) normal strategies for gaining quantitative information incorporate: (a)Experiments: Typically carried out in controlled settings.  (b)Questionnaires: uses structured questionnaires that have been prepared in advance. The respondent is required to select one of the specific, in-depth questions. The best example is a closed-ended questionnaire in which respondents are asked to answer with "Yes," "No," "True," or "False."

A rating on a scale (for example, rate a statement from "agree" to "disagree" on a scale of 1 to 4), a list of options (for example, choose from potential partner institutions with which a program could partner), or estimates of the amount of time participants might spend participating in an activity (for example, the percentage of time spent on teacher-led instruction or cooperative learning) are all examples of responses.    There are several factors to consider when choosing the best method for collecting surveys. Question difficulty, resource availability, project schedule, and other factors were considered. Web-based surveys, for example, are attractive for several reasons. First, collected data can be entered directly into the database, reducing the time and steps between data collection and analysis. Then you can incorporate checks to prevent out-of-range answers from being entered. If you need to interview a large number of people or have specific questions answered, surveys are often the best option. Polls are a useful tool for gathering information on various topics when you don't want detailed scrutiny of the answers. They are suitable for both formative and summative applications. On a regular basis, the same surveys are often used to monitor progress along dimensions and changes in behaviour over time. 6.1 Qualitative Data Analysis Techniques Green and Thorogood (2009) state that common methods for analyzing qualitative data include narrative analysis, evidenced theory, thematic content analysis, and frame analysis. The purpose of qualitative data analysis is to derive conclusions, judgments, and recommendations from findings using value statements, criteria, and criteria. The most common approaches to data analysis are outlined below. 6.1.1 Thematic content analysis Thematic analysis is a powerful and flexible method for analyzing qualitative data that can be used in a variety of paradigmatic or epistemological orientations. According to Kiger & Varpio (2020), this method of analysis is suitable for those who want to understand experiences,  concepts,  or  behaviors  across  collections  of  data.  Topics  are  actively  constructed  patterns  (or meanings) formed from collections of data that address research problems, as opposed to simple summaries or code taxonomies. These themes can be created using inductive or deductive approaches. The most widely used framework for topic analysis describes the 6-step process as follows:i) create provisional code; ii) find a topic; iii) rate the topic; iv) Define and name your topic. v) Write a report. 2003, Joffe and Yardley). Post-positivist, constructivist, and critical realist research methods can use thematic analysis. According to Braun & Clarke (2006), paradigmatic views do not prevent him. When applying topic analysis to different research paradigms, the method should be tailored to the desired results. Brown and Clarke (2006) also argue that post-positivists use thematic analysis to focus on people's meanings and experiences, gaining insight into the outside world, thereby promoting the development of speculative knowledge about reality. In many interpretivist schools, 
Journal of Marketing and Consumer Research                                                                                                                                  www.iiste.orgISSN 2422-8451 An International Peer-reviewed Journal Vol.87, 2022 67 such as constructivism, thematic analysis can likewise highlight the social, cultural, and structural contexts that influence an individual's experience. This enables the development of knowledge that is constructed through interactions between the researcher and the research participants and reveals the meanings that are socially constructed. Thematic content analysis therefore examines the content of the data to find common themes. Data is analyzed and coded until new patterns begin to emerge. Furthermore, this approach could be considered by researchers interested in gaining understanding of phenomena by analyzing their content and identifying themes. 6.1.2 Grounded theory Coding frameworks are built following a cyclical process of collecting and analyzing data. Additional data can be collected until a saturation point is reached. Therefore, method design and execution must be iterative. 6.1.3 Narrative analysis Is the study of the craft of storytelling in terms of how it is constructed, how it uses language and cultural materials, and how it convinces the audience that it is true. 7.1 Quantitative Data Analysis Techniques There are many statistical techniques for analyzing quantitative data. Descriptive statistics describe trends in data in an easy-to-understand way (Carroll & Rothe, 2010). In most cases, descriptive results are further analyzed and hypotheses are tested using inference techniques. On the other hand, the relationship between independent and dependent variables is the focus of univariate analysis methods (Collins, KM, 2018). Collins argues that analytical techniques can also be used to predict the effect of independent variables on dependent variables. Multivariate statistical analysis looks at many independent variables and many dependent variables to see if there is a correlation between them. Quantitative data can be analysed using parametric and nonparametric statistics. Parametric statistics require data to adhere to strict assumptions so that variables can be measured on interval or ratio scales. Nonparametric statistical analysis, on the other hand, uses ordinal and nominal data and does not rely on the same assumptions as parametric statistics. Furthermore, quantitative analysis is supported by statistical analysis methods. The statistical methods used fall into two main branches: Descriptive and inferential statistics. A study may use only descriptive statistics or a combination of both, depending on what you are looking for. Therefore, it depends on the research question, goals and objectives. Descriptive Statistical Research Descriptive statistics is a data analysis term that helps describe, present, or summarize data in a meaningful way so that patterns can be revealed from the data, for example. However, descriptive statistics cannot draw conclusions about the data you analyze or the hypotheses you set. They are simply ways of describing the data. Descriptive statistics are very important. This is because it is difficult to imagine what the data is telling you by simply presenting the raw data. Especially if you have a lot of data. Descriptive statistics can therefore present the

For example, if you have 100 coursework results from students, you might be interested in the overall performance of those students. We are also interested in the distribution or spread of grades. Descriptive statistics make this possible. There are two general types of statistics commonly used to describe data: Measures of central tendency: : These are ways of describing the center position of the frequency distribution of a set of data. In this case, the frequency distribution is simply the distribution and pattern (from lowest to highest) of grades obtained by 100 students. Many statistics can be used to explain this central position, including mode, median, and mean. Measures of Spread/Measures of Dispersion: These are ways of summarizing groups of data by describing how the scores are distributed. For example, the average score of 100 students might be 65 out of 100 for her. However, not all students achieve 65 points. Rather, those points are distributed. Some will be lower, some will be higher. A measure of variance helps summarize how these values are spread out. There are many statistics at your disposal to describe this spread: range, quartiles, absolute  deviation,  variance,  standard  deviation,  etc.  When  using  descriptive  statistics,  it  makes  sense  to summarize the data set using a combination of tabular descriptions (such as tables), graphical descriptions (such as graphs and charts), and statistical commentary. Inferential Statistics As noted already, descriptive statistics provide information about immediate datasets. For example, calculating the mean and standard deviation of 1000 students' test scores provides valuable information about her group of 1000 students. A group of such data that contains all the data of interest is called a population. The population can be small or large as long as it contains all the data of interest. For example, if you are only interested in the exam grades of 1000 students, 1000 students represent the population. Descriptive statistics are applied to populations. Population properties such as mean and standard deviation are called parameters because they represent the entire population (that is, all people of interest). However, in many cases, we do not have access to the entire population we want to study, but only a limited amount of data. For example, suppose you are interested in the exam scores of all Zambian students. Since it is not possible to measure all exam scores for all students across Zambia, we measure a small sample of students (e.g. 1000 students) used to represent a larger population of all students in Zambia. need to do it. Sample properties such as mean and standard deviation are called statistics rather than parameters. Inferential statistics are techniques that use these samples to allow generalizations about the population from which the sample was drawn. Therefore, it is important that the sample accurately represents the population. The process of achieving this is called sampling (sampling strategies are detailed on our sister site here).

Inferential statistics methods include (1) estimating parameters and (2) testing statistical hypotheses. 8.1   CONCLUSIONThe purpose of this article was to highlight the factors that determine how study designs are used, to analyse the methodological strategies used in the three study design continuum, and to discuss aspects of methodological strategies.  It worth noting that there are three main study design methods. Qualitative, quantitative and mixed method designs. The philosophy behind the research, investigator direction, time limits, and budget constraints all influence investigators in deciding which design to use. Additionally, it can be theoretically and empirically be concluded that a research design is a methodical strategy or concept utilised in a variety of research study activities. Understanding the research design is essential for the researcher to perform their task correctly. A well-thought-out research design helps to make sure that a researcher's methods are in line with the study's goals, that high-quality data are collected, that the right kind of analysis is used to answer research questions, and that trustworthy sources are used. Understanding the concepts behind a research project is essential for researchers. This is because a strong study design provides detail at each stage, identifies relevant major and minor tasks, and enables researchers to make informed decisions at each stage. , to make research more interesting and effective. Researchers can quickly define the goals of their research work, complete their research goals within a specific time frame, and use research designs to facilitate finding the best solutions to their research problems. The results also indicated that study design is a methodological approach or concept used  to conduct various research activities. Ultimately, we deliver research that is accurate, reliable, and consistent. Understanding research design is essential for researchers to do their jobs correctly. A well-thought-out study design ensures that the investigator's methods are consistent with the study's goals, that high-quality data are collected, and that the appropriate type of analysis is used to answer the study's question. and that reliable sources are used. . Understanding the concepts behind a research project is essential for researchers. This is because a strong study design provides detail at each stage, identifies relevant major and minor tasks, and enables researchers to make informed decisions at each stage, to make research more responsive to the business, socio-economic and political  needs and challenges  of individuals, society and the country at large.
